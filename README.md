# Sample todo app on AWS

Hi guys! In this post, we'll be building a sample todo app on AWS with Python. We will build a website called  [todo.houessou.com](https://todo.houessou.com) that enables logged in visitors to create their todo list. We will use the AWS Serverless Application Model SAM Framework to deploy the backend services - API, Lambda, DynamoDB and Cognito) and will host the frontend on S3 behind a CloudFront distribution.
The frontend is basic with no fancy visuals (I am no frontend dev :p). Here we will focus on how the resources are created and deployed on AWS.

## Overview

In this post I will be going through the overall setup of the app and how I deployed it. Mostly this will be a theoretical post but I will be posting needed scripts wherever appropriate. All the code can be found in the **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/hpfpv/todo-app-aws)**.

### About the App

Before I go into the architecture, let me describe what the app is about and what it does. The app is a todo list manager which helps a user manage and track his/her todo list along with their files or attachments. The user can also find specific todos through the search. 

### Basic Functionality

![appflow.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627647453541/A17idrTi1.png)
The image above should describe the app basic functionalities.

**User/Login Management**: 
*Users are able to login to the app using provided credentials. There is a self register functionality and once a user is registered, the app provides a capability to the user to login using those credentials. It also provides a logout option for the user.*

**Search Todo**: 
*Users are able to perform a keyword search and the app shows a list of todos which contain that keyword in the name. The search only searches on todos which the logged in user has created. So it has the access boundary and doesnâ€™t show Recipes across users.*

**Add New Todo**: 
*Users can add new Todos to be stored in the app. There are various details which can be provided for each Todo. Users can also add notes for each Todo.*

**Support for files**: 
*Users can upload a todo files for each Todo. The app provides a capability where user can select and upload a local file or download existing files while adding notes to a Todo. The file can be anything, from a text file to an image file. The app stores it in a S3 bucket and serves it back to the user via CloudFront.*

### Application Components
Now that we have a basic functional understanding of the app, let's see how all of these functionalities translate to different technical components. Below image should provide a good overview of each layer of the app and the technical components involved in each layer.
![app-components.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627943517673/XSNN_3bOs.png)

Let's go through each component.

The steps to build this application are:
- Build and deploy backend main resources - **DynamoDB, Lambda and API Gateway**
- Enable users authentication - **Cognito**
- Build a frontend website to serve the app - **S3, CloudFront**
Alright, let's break this down.

## Build and deploy backend

Our backend is based on the Serverless Application Module. We will need a DynamoDb table to store users todo-list, lambda functions to query and write to the table and REST APIs to serve the lambda functions.

1- To keep things simple, each document in DynamoDb will represent one todo with attributes as follow:

- *todoID* : unique number identifying todo, will serve as primary key
- *userID* : ID of the user who created the todo, will serve as sort key
- *dateCreated* : date todo has been created, today's date
- *dateDue* : date the todo is due, user provided
- *title* : todo title, user provided
- *description* : todo description, user provided
- *notes* : additional notes for todo, can be added anytime after todo is created, black by default
- *completed* : TRUE or FALSE if todo is marked as completed

2- Our [lambda functions](https://github.com/hpfpv/todo-app-aws/tree/main/backend/functions) will perform CRUD operations on the DynamoDB Table as follow:

- *getTodos* : retrieve all todos for a userID
- *getTodo* : return detailed information about one todo based on the todoID attribute 
- *addTodo* : create a todo for a specific user based on the userID
- *completeTodo* : update todo record and set completed attribute to TRUE based on todoID 
- *addTodoNotes* : update todo record and set the notes attribute to the specified value based on todoID

3- Our REST API will have 5 routes to trigger the lambda functions based on the path and parameters provided:

- *getTodos* : /{**userID**}/todos
- *getTodo* : /{**userID**}/todos/{**todoID**}
- *addTodo* : /{**userID**}/todos/add
- *completeTodo* : /{**userID**}/todos/{**todoID**}/complete
- *addTodoNotes* : /{**userID**}/todos/{**todoID**}/addnotes

Since the retrieval of todos is per user based, we need to add the authentication layer using Cognito.
For that, we have to create a Cognito user pool, user pool client and domain. We also need to set the Auth property on the API by adding cognito as authorizers backed by *jwt*.

With all the information above, we can write the [SAM template](https://github.com/hpfpv/todo-app-aws/blob/main/backend/template.yaml) as follow:

**API**

```

After building and deploying our backend using the aws sam cli, we can now test our API along with the lambda functions.
Let's build a frontend website that will serve our todo app.


## Frontend website

Our frontend is made of basic html and Javascript code. 

1- We created 4 html files all referring to functions inside one [Javascript file](https://github.com/hpfpv/todo-app-aws/blob/main/frontend/js/script.js) which handles the frontend logic as follow:

- *index.html* : login page, displays a container that retrieves username and password as input, calls the **login()** function from the Javascript file

- *register.html* : registration page for new users, calls the **register()** function from the Javascript file

- *confirm.html* : account confirmation page after registration, calls the **confirm()** function from the Javascript file

- *home.html* : This is the main frontend logic page. 
   Users get redirected to this page after a successful user sign in. 
   
   It displays a grid of all 
   todos related to the signed in user in a container - calls the **getTodos()** function 
   from the Javascript file. 

   Users can add a new todo - calls the **addTodo()** function from the Javascript file. 

   Users can click on one todo to show its details - calls the **getTodo()** function from 
   the Javascript file. Users can add notes on the fly to the displayed todo - calls the 
   **saveTodoNotes() ** function from the Javascript file. 

   Users can mark todo as 
   completed - calls the **completeTodo()** function from the Javascript file.
